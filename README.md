About The Project
J.A.R.V.I.S. is a Python-based voice-controlled personal assistant for your desktop. Inspired by the AI from the Iron Man movies, this project is designed to perform various automated tasks based on voice commands. By integrating the OpenAI API, J.A.R.V.I.S. goes beyond simple commands to offer intelligent, conversational AI capabilities.

This model is built to understand human speech and respond with relevant actions or information, from opening applications to answering complex questions.
